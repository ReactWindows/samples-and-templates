The [Windows App SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK) aims to bring the best of UWP technologies to desktop apps ("Win32"). It is an umbrella of related libraries that enable building apps using the most modern Windows development technologies: from 2D drawing through [Win2D](https://github.com/microsoft/Win2D), assets/resources management through [MRTCore](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/project-reunion/mrtcore/mrtcore-overview), to the latest WinUI framework, [WinUI 3](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui3/get-started-winui3-for-desktop).

React Native for Windows has enabled developers to create UWP apps that use XAML and WinUI 2.x for some time. We're thrilled to announce that we now have experimental support for desktop C# .net 5 apps through the Windows App SDK!
In this post I'm going to walk you through what it takes to create such an app, its characteristics, and limitations.

# Requirements
This walkthrough assumes you have already installed the requirements:
1. [React Native for Windows requirements](https://aka.ms/rnw-deps)
2. [.net 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)

# Project Setup

If you want the quick version, you can skip the details below and just clone the [rn64Reunion](https://github.com/asklar/rn64Reunion) repo. This repo contains a C# app built with .net 5, that uses the Windows App SDK as well as a new React Native for Windows NuGet package specially made for consumption in Windows App SDK apps, courtesy of [cswinrt](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT). 

After you have cloned the repo, run `yarn` to bring down the JavaScript dependencies.

## Details
Now for the details: this app was built by starting out with a blank C# .net 5 Windows App SDK app, which you can do yourself in Visual Studio by downloading the [Windows App SDK extension](https://aka.ms/projectreunion/previewdownload) for Visual Studio, and creating a new project.
The template creates an `App.xaml.cs` and a `MainWindow.xaml.cs`. 

1. Reference the projection package:

    The first step is to reference the React Native for Windows projection package. To do that, right click on the app project > click "Manage NuGet packages" and search for [Microsoft.ReactNative.AppSDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ReactNative.AppSDK/).
2. Add a `ReactRootView` to your `MainWindow.xaml`:
    ```xml
    <Window
        x:Class="RN64Reunion.MainWindow"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        xmlns:local="using:RN64Reunion"
        xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
        xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
        xmlns:rnw="using:Microsoft.ReactNative"
        mc:Ignorable="d">

        <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" HorizontalAlignment="Center" VerticalAlignment="Center">
            <rnw:ReactRootView x:Name="reactRootView" MinWidth="400" MinHeight="600" ComponentName="rn64Reunion" />
        </StackPanel>
    </Window>
    ```
3. In your `App.xaml.cs`, modify the app constructor to set up the React Instance:
    ```cs
    public partial class App : Microsoft.ReactNative.ReactApplication
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Initializes the singleton application object.  This is the first line of authored code
        /// executed, and as such is the logical equivalent of main() or WinMain().
        /// </summary>
        public App()
        {
            JavaScriptBundleFile = "index";
            InstanceSettings.UseWebDebugger = true;
            InstanceSettings.UseFastRefresh = true;

            InstanceSettings.UseDeveloperSupport = true;

            this.InitializeComponent();
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Invoked when the application is launched normally by the end user.  Other entry points
        /// will be used such as when the application is launched to open a specific file.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="args">Details about the launch request and process.</param>
        protected override void OnLaunched(Microsoft.UI.Xaml.LaunchActivatedEventArgs args)
        {
            m_window = new MainWindow();
            m_window.Title = "React Native for Windows - Project Reunion";

            m_window.Activate();
        }

        private Window m_window;
    }
    ```

4. Connect the main window to the app host:
    ```cs
    public sealed partial class MainWindow : Window
    {
        public MainWindow()
        {
            this.InitializeComponent();
            reactRootView.Loaded += ReactRootView_Loaded;
        }

        private async void ReactRootView_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            var app = Application.Current as App;
            XamlUIService.SetXamlRoot(app.Host.InstanceSettings.Properties, this.Content.XamlRoot);
            reactRootView.ReactNativeHost = app.Host;
            await app.Host.LoadInstance();
        }
    }
    ```

5. Copy the "React Native" pieces from the template app

    The steps above take care of the _native_ part of React Native, so now it is time to bring in some JavaScript to the mix.
    Create a React Native for Windows app by following the instructions in the ["Get Started with Windows" guide](http://aka.ms/ReactNativeGuideWindows). To summarize:
    a. `npx react-native init myProjectName --template react-native@^0.64.0`
    b. `cd myProjectName`
    c. `npx react-native-windows-init --overwrite`

6. Replace the template UWP app with the Windows App SDK app we created in steps 1-4.

    Delete the contents of `windows\myProjectName` and copy the desktop app in its place. Delete the `windows\myProjectName.sln` file and recreate it in Visual Studio to point to the desktop app.


## Build
1. on the command line, run `yarn start` to start the Metro bundler. 
2. In Visual Studio, open the solution, make sure x64 is selected, and press F5 to run it.

React Native for Windows has historically been distributed as source. This works great for developers that need to customize the framework to suit their needs, however we don't expect most people to need to do this. Having to build a large amount of C++ code like the React Native for Windows framework can take a long time, so if you don't need to make any framework changes, it's much faster to just use a pre-built version of the framework, which is what the NuGet packages provide. In our case this is powered by the Windows App SDK projection of React Native for Windows provides, Microsoft.ReactNative.AppSDK.

Because we are using a pre-built version of the framework, and because we are using C# for the app's code (which in general compiles faster than C++ code), our app build times are lightning fast: about 15 seconds on my machine, compared to 20-30 minutes for an equivalent project building the framework from source!

## Current limitations and Future work
The Windows App SDK support of React Native for Windows is experimental at this point in time, with the following limitations:
- C# Win32 apps on .net 5 or higher
- Uses WinUI 3, so not all Windows XAML features/controls are available (e.g. inking, maps, media player element). See the WinUI documentation for details.
- Does not yet support Native Modules 

Having said that, we would love to get your feedback on what we think is a much improved developer experience, and the ability to leverage the newest and most exciting Windows development stack! Drop us a tweet or file an issue if you hit a problem.
