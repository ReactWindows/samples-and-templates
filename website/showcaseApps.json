        "Notice the beautiful user experience including animations and multimedia. Performance is also super snappy. The Xbox app initially explored using Electron, but found that React Native helped them make a super performant app.",
        "In their tests, the Xbox team found that memory consumption went from 1.6 gigs down to 350mb; CPU usage spikes went from 50% down to 30%.",
        "And users are taking notice – in a survey, the team found that over 95% of users surveyed notice that the app’s performance was the same or better than before.",
        "Not only that, but the team was able to port their entire app from Electron to React Native with a lean crew of a few devs within a few short months."
